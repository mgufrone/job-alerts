TempMee is changing the way the world works - starting with the Dental Industry! We are an ambitious and motivated tech startup that has secured multiple rounds of venture backing to create an Uber-like platform/app to disrupt the dental staffing industry. After launching in late 2019, we have already built the largest community of nationwide hygienists and dental offices, dwarfing our established competition in the dental tech staffing space. It is truly a matter of time until TempMee is the industry standard for dental staffing needs in the Dental Community!<br /><br />
We are in the process of rapidly expanding the capabilities and functions of our app to capture even more market share, and we need high-quality developers like you to come aboard and help make TempMee a Unicorn (Unicorn=Start-ups evaluated at $1 billion within five years of launch).<br /><br />

- 3 years of experience testing, maintaining, or launching software products, and 1 year of experience with software design and architecture<br />
- Solid programming skills in JavaScript and/or Golang<br />
- Knowledge of basic visual and user experience principles<br />
- Experience in building pixel-perfect design implementation<br />
- Deep understanding of relational database systems, specifically MySQL and Postgres<br />
- Understanding NoSQL Datastores such as ElasticSearch, MongoDB is a plus<br />
- Experience building scalable, performant, and modular solutions<br />
- Understanding of modern cloud technologies such as AWS and Google Cloud<br />
- Experience with microservices and service-oriented architecture<br /><br />
What you&#039;ll do<br /><br />

- Research novel solutions to nuanced and often unchartered engineering challenges<br />
- Work with designers, product managers, and engineers to design impactful products<br />
